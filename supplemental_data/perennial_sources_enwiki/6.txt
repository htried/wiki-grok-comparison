There is consensus that preprints are [[WP:SPS|self-published source]]s, and are generally unreliable with the exception of papers authored by established [[subject-matter expert]]s.

| Additional considerations apply to the use of [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] (RFE/RL). RFE/RL should be used cautiously, if at all, for reporting published from the 1950s to the early 1970s, when RFE/RL had a documented relationship with the CIA. RFE/RL may be biased in some subject areas (particularly through omission of relevant, countervailing facts), and in those areas, it should be attributed in the article body. There is no consensus as to what subject areas require attribution. The scope of topics requiring attribution of RFE/RL should be decided on a case-by-case basis.

| RhythmOne (which acquired All Media Guide, formerly AllRovi) has operated the websites [[AllMusic]], [[AllMovie]] (until 2024), and AllGame (defunct). There is consensus that RhythmOne websites are usable for entertainment reviews with [[WP:INTEXT|in-text attribution]]. Some editors question the accuracy of these websites for [[WP:BLP|biographical details]] and recommend more reliable sources when available. Editors also advise against using AllMusic's [[Music genre|genre]] classifications from the website's summaries at the top of a page. Listings without accompanying prose do not count toward [[WP:N|notability]]. ''See also: [[#AllMovie|AllMovie]], following its acquisition from RhythmOne.''

| RIA Novosti was an official news agency of the Russian government. There is a broad consensus that it is a [[WP:BIASED|biased and opinionated]] source. It is generally considered usable for official government statements and positions. There is no consensus on whether it is reliable for other topics, though opinions generally lean towards unreliability.

''Rolling Stone''<nowiki/>'s [[WP:RSOPINION|opinion pieces]] and reviews, as well as any contentious statements regarding [[WP:BLP|living persons]], should only be used with [[WP:INTEXT|attribution]]. The publication's [[capsule reviews]] deserve [[WP:DUE|less weight]] than their full-length reviews, as they are subject to a lower standard of fact-checking.

| According to a 2021 RfC discussion, there is unanimous consensus among editors that ''Rolling Stone'' is generally unreliable for politically and societally sensitive issues reported since 2011 (inclusive), though it must be borne in mind that this date is an estimate and not a definitive cutoff, as the deterioration of journalistic practices happened gradually. Some editors have said that low-quality reporting also appeared in some preceding years, but a specific date after which the articles are considered generally unreliable has not been proposed. Previous consensus was that ''Rolling Stone'' was generally reliable for political and societal topics before 2011. Most editors say that ''Rolling Stone'' is a [[WP:PARTISAN|partisan source]] in the field of politics, and that their statements in this field should be [[WP:INTEXT|attributed]]. Moreover, [[WP:MEDRS|medical]] or [[WP:SCIRS|scientific]] claims should not be sourced to the publication.

| There is unanimous consensus among editors that ''Culture Council'' articles (of URL form rollingstone.com/culture-council/*) are [[WP:SPS|self-published sources]] and are, in most aspects, equivalent to [[WP:FORBESCON|''Forbes''-]] and [[WP:RSP#HuffPost contributors|''HuffPost''-]]contributors. Editors, however, have also expressed concern that at least some of the content published is [[WP:PROMO|promotional]] and thus not usable. Editors should thus determine on a case-by-case basis whether the opinions published there are [[WP:IS|independent]] and also if they constitute [[WP:DUE|due weight]]. Usage of these sources for [[WP:THIRDPARTY|third-party claims]] in [[WP:BLP|biographies of living persons]] as well as [[WP:MEDRS|medical or scientific claims]] is not allowed.
