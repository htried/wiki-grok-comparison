| Baidu Baike was deprecated in the 2020 RfC as it is similar to an [[WP:UGC|open wiki]], which is a type of [[WP:SPS|self-published source]]. Although edits are reviewed by Baidu administrators before they are published, most editors believe the editorial standards of Baidu Baike to be very low, and do not see any evidence of fact-checking. The [[Baidu 10 Mythical Creatures]] [[kuso]] originated from Baidu Baike. The Baidu Baike domain also includes a website archiving service (baike.baidu.com/reference), which unlike the encyclopedia articles (which are hosted under baike.baidu.com/item/), are acceptable to use as accessible links for reliable sources.

| BBC is a British [[Public broadcasting|publicly funded broadcaster]]. It is considered generally reliable. This includes [[BBC News]], BBC documentaries, and the BBC History site (on [[BBC Online]]). However, this excludes BBC projects that incorporate [[WP:UGC|user-generated content]] (such as [[h2g2]] and the [[BBC Domesday Project]]) and BBC publications with reduced editorial oversight (such as ''[[Collective (BBC)|Collective]]''). [[WP:RSOPINION|Statements of opinion]] should conform to the corresponding guideline.

| ''[[China Daily]]'' is a publication owned by the [[Chinese Communist Party]]. The 2021 RfC found narrow consensus against deprecating ''China Daily'', owing to the lack of available usable sources for Chinese topics. There is consensus that ''China Daily'' may be used, cautiously and with good editorial judgment, as a source for the position of the Chinese authorities and the Chinese Communist Party; as a source for the position of ''China Daily'' itself; as a source for facts about non-political events in mainland China, while noting that (a) ''China Daily''{{'}}s interpretation of those facts is likely to contain political spin, and (b) ''China Daily's'' omission of details from a story should not be used to determine that such details are untruthful; and, with great caution, as a supplementary (but not sole) source for facts about political events of mainland China. Editors agree that when using this source, [[WP:RSCONTEXT|context matters]] a great deal and the facts should be separated from ''China Daily''{{'}}s view about those facts. It is best practice to use [[WP:INTEXT|in-text attribution]] and [[WP:IC|inline citations]] when sourcing content to ''China Daily''.

| ''CNET'' was acquired by digital marketing company [[Red Ventures]] in October 2020, leading to a deterioration in editorial standards. Staff writers were pressured by company executives to publish content more favorably to advertisers in order to benefit Red Ventures' business dealings; this included both news stories and reviews.

| {{WP:RSPLAST|2025}}
| Concerns over ''CNET''{{'}}s advertiser-driven editorial content remain unresolved. Separately, in November 2022, it began deploying an experimental AI tool to rapidly generate articles riddled with factual inaccuracies and affiliate links, with the purpose of increasing [[SEO]] [[Search engine results page|rankings]]. CNET never formally disclosed its use of AI until ''[[Futurism (website)|Futurism]]'' and ''[[The Verge]]'' published reports exposing its actions. An AI tool now announced to be paused wrote more than 70 finance-related articles and published them under the byline "CNET Money Staff", over half of which received corrections after mounting pressure. In August 2024 CNET was purchased by [[Ziff Davis]], which may mean that the reasons for considering it unreliable may no longer apply.

| ''CounterPunch'' is a left-wing political opinion magazine. Despite the fact that the publication has an editorial board, there is no effective editorial control over the content of the publication, so articles should be treated as [[WP:SPS|self-published sources]]. As a consequence, the articles should generally be avoided and should not be used to establish [[WP:N|notability]] unless published by subject-matter experts writing about subjects within their domain of expertise, in which case they may be considered reliable for facts. Citing ''CounterPunch'' for third-party claims about [[WP:BLP|living persons]] is [[WP:BLPSPS|not allowed]]. All articles on ''CounterPunch'' must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, in particular for [[WP:DUE|due weight]], and opinions must be [[WP:INTEXT|attributed]]. Some articles in the publication promote conspiracy theories and historical [[denialism]], but there was no consensus to deprecate the outlet based on the most recent RfC.

| In the 2017 RfC, the ''Daily Mail'' was the first source to be deprecated on Wikipedia, and the decision was challenged and reaffirmed in the 2019 RfC. There is consensus that the ''Daily Mail'' (including its online version, ''[[MailOnline]]'') is generally unreliable, and its use as a reference is generally prohibited, especially when other sources exist that are more reliable. As a result, the ''Daily Mail'' should not be used for determining notability, nor should it be used as a source in articles. The ''Daily Mail'' has a "reputation for poor fact checking, sensationalism, and flat-out fabrication". The ''Daily Mail'' may be used in rare cases in an [[WP:ABOUTSELF|about-self fashion]]. Some editors regard the ''Daily Mail'' as reliable historically, so old articles may be used in a historical context. (Note that dailymail.co.uk is not trustworthy as a source of past content that was printed in the ''Daily Mail''.) The restriction is often incorrectly interpreted as a "ban" on the ''Daily Mail''. The deprecation includes other editions of the UK ''Daily Mail'', such as the Irish and Scottish editions. The UK ''Daily Mail'' is not to be confused with [[Daily Mail (disambiguation)|other publications named ''Daily Mail'']] that are unaffiliated with the UK paper.<!-- Disambiguation on purpose --> The dailymail.com domain was previously used by the unaffiliated ''[[Charleston Daily Mail]]'', and reference links to that publication are still present.

| The ''Daily NK'' is an [[online newspaper]] based in [[South Korea]] that reports on stories based inside of [[North Korea]]. There is no consensus as to if it should be deprecated or used with attribution. There is a consensus that this source, as well as all other sources reporting on North Korea, is generally unreliable. However, due to a paucity of readily accessible information on North Korea, as well as a perception that ''Daily NK'' is not more unreliable than other sources on the topic, it can be used as a source, albeit with great caution.

| There is consensus that ''The Diplomat'' is generally reliable. Opinion pieces should be evaluated by [[WP:RSOPINION]] and [[WP:NEWSBLOG]]. Some editors have expressed concern on their reliability for North Korea-related topics.

| The content on Discogs is [[WP:UGC|user-generated]], and is therefore generally unreliable. There was consensus against deprecating Discogs in a 2019 RfC, as editors noted that, although it should not be cited, [[WP:EL|external links]] to the site may be appropriate.

| There is consensus that ''Distractify'' is generally unreliable. Editors believe ''Distractify'' runs run-of-the-mill gossip that is unclearly either [[WP:UGC|user-generated]] or written by staff members. Editors should especially refrain from using it in [[WP:BLP|BLP]]s.

| {{rsnl|446|RfC: The Dorchester Review|2024|rfc=y}}
| {{WP:RSPLAST|2024|stale=n}}
| There is consensus ''The Dorchester Review'' is generally unreliable, as it is not peer reviewed by the wider academic community. It has a poor reputation for fact-checking and lacks an editorial team. The source may still be used in some circumstances e.g. for uncontroversial self-descriptions, and content authored by established subject-matter experts.

| Dotdash Meredith (formerly known as About.com) operates a network of websites. Editors find the quality of articles published by About.com to be inconsistent. Some editors recommend treating About.com articles as [[WP:SPS|self-published sources]], and only using articles published by established experts. About.com also previously served as a [[WP:MIRROR|Wikipedia mirror]]; using republished Wikipedia content is considered [[WP:CIRCULAR|circular sourcing]]. In 2017, the About.com website became defunct and some of its content was moved to Dotdash Meredith's current website brands.<ref>{{cite news|first1=Emily|last1=Dreyfuss|accessdate=December 29, 2018|title=RIP About.com|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/05/rip-com-look-tumultuous-life-web-legend/|newspaper=Wired|date=May 3, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180825163605/https://www.wired.com/2017/05/rip-com-look-tumultuous-life-web-legend/|archive-date=August 25, 2018|url-status=live|url-access=limited|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first1=Mike|last1=Shields|accessdate=December 29, 2018|title=About.com had become a web relic, so its owner blew it up – and now it's enjoying a surge in revenue|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/aboutcom-had-become-a-relic-of-the-web-so-its-owner-blew-it-up-now-its-enjoying-a-surge-in-revenue-2017-12|website=Business Insider|date=December 18, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180625171227/http://www.businessinsider.com/aboutcom-had-become-a-relic-of-the-web-so-its-owner-blew-it-up-now-its-enjoying-a-surge-in-revenue-2017-12|archive-date=June 25, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Due to persistent abuse, verywellfamily.com, verywellhealth.com, and verywellmind.com are on the [[WP:SPB|Wikipedia spam blacklist]], and links must be [[Wikipedia talk:WHITELIST|whitelisted]] before they can be used.
