| There is consensus that ''The Washington Times'' is a marginally reliable source for politics and science. Most editors agree that it is a [[WP:PARTISAN|partisan]] source. Some editors noted a history of publishing inaccurate or false information, of being slow to issue retractions or corrections, and of sometimes only doing so under the threat of legal action; a considerable minority favored deprecation on these grounds. ''The Washington Times'' is probably suitable for its mundane political coverage, although better sources should be preferred when available. ''The Washington Times'' should generally not be used for contentious claims, especially about [[WP:BLP|living persons]]. A majority of editors regard ''The Washington Times'' as generally reliable for topics other than politics and science. Opinion columns are governed by [[WP:RSOPINION]] and [[WP:NEWSBLOG]]. Some editors observed that ''The Washington Times'' has a [[WP:COI|conflict of interest]] regarding the [[Unification movement]] and related topics.

| Uniquely among WMF sites, Wikidata's statements can be directly transcluded into articles; this is usually done to provide external links or infobox data. For example, more than two million external links from Wikidata are shown through the {{tl|Authority control}} template. There has been controversy over the use of Wikidata in the English Wikipedia due to its infancy, its vandalism issues and its sourcing. While there is no consensus on whether information from Wikidata should be used at all, there is general agreement that any Wikidata statements transcluded need to be just as – or more – reliable compared to Wikipedia content. As such, [[Module:WikidataIB]] and some related modules and templates filter unsourced Wikidata statements by default; however, other modules and templates, such as [[Module:Wikidata]], do not.

| WikiLeaks is a repository of [[WP:PRIMARY|primary source]] documents [[News leak|leaked]] by [[anonymous sources]]. No consensus exists on its reliability. Some editors questioned the applicability of reliability ratings to Wikileaks. Some editors believe that documents from WikiLeaks fail the [[WP:V|verifiability policy]], because WikiLeaks does not adequately authenticate them, and there are concerns regarding whether the documents are genuine or tampered. It may be appropriate to cite a document from WikiLeaks as a [[WP:PRIMARY|primary source]], but only if it is discussed by a [[WP:RS|reliable source]].

| The World Socialist Web Site is the online news and information publication of the [[International Committee of the Fourth International]], a [[Trotskyist]] political organisation. Most editors consider it to be reliable for the [[WP:INTEXT|attributed]] [[WP:RSOPINION|opinions]] of its authors. There is no consensus on whether it is reliable for factual reporting. If used, it must be evaluated for [[WP:UNDUE|due weight]] as it is an [[WP:BIASED|opinionated source]]. Some editors suggest that it may be more reliable for news related to labor issues.

| ''XBIZ'' is considered generally reliable for the adult industry. However, it publishes press releases/sponsored content without clearly delineating the distinction between their own journalism and the promotional content of others. Thus, editors should take care that the source is not used for content obviously or likely to be promotional.

| {{WP:RSPLAST|2021}}
| Xinhua News Agency is the official state-run press agency of the People's Republic of China. There is consensus that Xinhua is generally reliable for factual reporting except in areas where the government of China may have a reason to use it for propaganda or disinformation. Xinhua is also generally reliable for the views and positions of the Chinese government and its officials. For subjects where the Chinese government may be a stakeholder, the consensus is almost unanimous that Xinhua cannot be trusted to cover them accurately and dispassionately; some editors favour outright deprecation because of its lack of [[WP:IS|editorial independence]]. There is no consensus for applying any one single label to the whole of the agency. Caution should be exercised in using this source, extremely so in case of [[WP:REDFLAG|extraordinary claims]] on controversial subjects or [[WP:BLP|biographies of living people]]. When in doubt, try to find better sources instead; use [[WP:INTEXT|inline attribution]] if you must use Xinhua.

| ''Yahoo! News'' runs both original reporting and syndicated feeds of other sources. Editors have treated the original reporting as an ordinary [[WP:NEWSORG]], and thus presumed generally reliable. Take care with syndicated content, which varies from highly reliable sources to very unreliable sources. Syndicated content should be evaluated as you would evaluate the original source. Syndicated content will have the original source's name and/or logo at the top.

| {{WP:RSPLAST|2024}}
| ZDNet was acquired by digital marketing company Red Ventures in October 2020. There is consensus that ZDNet, along with other online properties of Red Ventures, is generally unreliable. Editors express concern that Red Ventures, as a matter of policy, uses AI-authored content on its properties in a non-transparent and unreliable manner. ZDNET was purchased by Ziff Davis in August 2024, which may mean that the reasons for considering it unreliable may no longer apply.
