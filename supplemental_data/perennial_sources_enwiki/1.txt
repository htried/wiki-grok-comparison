| 112 Ukraine was deprecated following a 2019 RfC, which showed overwhelming consensus for the deprecation of a slew of sources associated with Russian disinformation in Ukraine. It was pointed out later in a 2020 RfC that 112 Ukraine had not been explicitly discussed in that first discussion prior to its blacklisting request. Further discussion established a rough consensus that the source is generally unreliable, but did not form a consensus for deprecation or blacklisting. The prior blacklisting was reversed as out of process. 112 Ukraine was shut down in 2021; website content is no longer accessible unless archived.

| {{WP:RSPLAST|2024}}
| There is consensus that, outside the context of the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], the ADL is generally a reliable source, particularly for topics related to hate groups and extremism in the U.S. There is no consensus that the ADL must always be attributed, but there is consensus that its labelling of organisations and individuals (especially as antisemitic) should be attributed. Some editors regard the ADL's opinion pieces as unreliable and should only be used with attribution. In the 2024 RfC, there was rough consensus that the [[List of symbols designated by the Anti-Defamation League as hate symbols|ADL's hate symbol]] database is reliable for identifying the existence of a symbol and for straightforward descriptive facts, but not for more complex details such as a symbol's history. In such cases, [[WP:INTEXT|in-text attribution]] to the ADL may be advisable.

| {{WP:RSPLAST|2024}}
| The ADL can roughly be taken as reliable on the topic of antisemitism when [[Israel]] and [[Zionism]] are not concerned, and the reliability is a case-by-case matter. There is consensus that the labelling of organisations and individuals by the ADL as antisemitic should be [[WP:INTEXT|attributed]]. The ADL has also demonstrated a habit of conflating [[Criticism of Israel|criticism of the Israeli government's actions]] with antisemitism.

| {{WP:RSPLAST|2024|stale=n}}
| There is consensus that the ADL is a generally unreliable source for the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, due to significant evidence that the ADL acts as a pro-Israeli advocacy group and has repeatedly published false and misleading statements as fact, un-retracted, regarding the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. The general unreliability of the ADL extends to the intersection of the topics of antisemitism and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.
