| Most editors consider ''The Economist'' a generally reliable news magazine focused on [[data journalism]]. Distinctively, its news articles appear without [[byline]]s and mixed with commentary. Within these news articles, Wikipedia editors should use their judgement to discern factual content – which can be generally relied upon – from analytical content, which should be used in accordance with the [[WP:RSOPINION|guideline on opinion in reliable sources]]. Its pseudonymous commentary columns and other opinion pieces should also be handled according to this guideline.

| There is no consensus regarding the reliability of the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' (including its online edition, [[Encyclopædia Britannica Online|''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Online]]). Its editorial process includes fact checking and publishing corrections. ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' is a [[WP:TERTIARY|tertiary source]]. Some online entries are written by subject matter experts, while others are written by freelancers or editors, and entries should be evaluated on an individual basis. Editors prefer reliable [[WP:SECONDARY|secondary sources]] over the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' when available. From 2009 to 2010, the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Online accepted a small number of content submissions from the general public. Although these submissions undergo the encyclopedia's editorial process, some editors believe that content from non-staff contributors is less reliable than the encyclopedia's staff-authored content. Content authorship is disclosed in the article history.

Editors show consensus for treating Forbes.com contributor articles as [[WP:SPS|self-published sources]], unless the article was written by a [[WP:EXPERTSOURCE|subject-matter expert]]. Forbes.com contributor articles should never be used for [[WP:THIRDPARTY|third-party claims]] about [[WP:BLPSPS|living persons]]. Forbes Councils, being pay-to-publish and similarly lacking oversight, also fall into this category.

Check the [[byline]] to determine whether an article is written by a "[[#Forbes|Forbes Staff]]" member, "Contributor", "Senior Contributor", or "Subscriber". In addition, check underneath the byline to see whether it was published in a print issue of ''Forbes''. Previously, Forbes.com contributor articles could have been identified by their [[URL]] beginning in "forbes.com/sites"; the URL no longer distinguishes them, as ''Forbes'' staff articles have also been moved under "/sites".

| There is consensus Fox News is generally unreliable for the reporting of politics, especially from November 2020 onwards. On the matter of science, and on the matter of pre-November 2020 politics, there is a consensus that the reliability of Fox News is unclear and that additional considerations apply to its use. As a result, Fox News is considered marginally reliable and generally does not qualify as a "high-quality source" for the purpose of substantiating exceptional claims in these topic areas. Editors perceive Fox News to be [[WP:BIASED|biased or opinionated]] for politics; use [[WP:INTEXT|in-text attribution]] for opinions.

| Gawker (2002–2016) was a gossip blog that frequently published articles on rumors and speculation without named authors. When Gawker is the only source for a piece of information, the information would likely constitute [[WP:DUE|undue weight]], especially when the subject is a [[WP:BLP|living person]]. When another reliable source quotes information from Gawker, it is preferable to cite that source instead. In the 2019 RfC, there was no consensus on whether Gawker should be deprecated. In 2021, the publication was relaunched under Bustle Digital Group, and subsequently closed in 2023. The second incarnation has not been discussed at RSN.

Inferring information solely from Street View pictures may be considered [[WP:No original research|original research]]. Note that due to [[restrictions on geographic data in China]], [[OpenStreetMap]] coordinates for places in [[mainland China]] are almost always much more accurate than Google's – despite OpenStreetMap being user-generated – due to the severe distortion introduced by most commercial map providers.
