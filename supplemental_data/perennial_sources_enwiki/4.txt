Due to the heightened requirements for [[WP:Biomedical information|biomedical]] and [[WP:MEDRS|medical sources]] on Wikipedia, the consensus of editors in the 2023 RfC was to deprecate Healthline as an unusable source that cannot meet [[WP:MEDRS]] and to blacklist Healthline for the safety and well-being of our readers.

| Due to security concerns, The Heritage Foundation is on the [[WP:SPB|Wikipedia spam blacklist]]: there is evidence that the group has planned to [[doxxing|doxx]] Wikipedia editors, and links to it should be bypassed or [[WP:WHITELIST|whitelisted]]. Editors who are victimized by doxxing tactics may [[:m:Legal/Legal Policies#Defense of Contributors|request assistance from the Wikimedia Foundation]], although support is not guaranteed.
The Heritage Foundation is an American conservative think tank; editors have found that it promotes disinformation. Heritage and its then-publication [[The Daily Signal]] were found generally unreliable due to the presumption of unreliability for [[think tank]]s and reporting such as [[climate change denial]]; the 2025 RfC deprecated Heritage. However, The Daily Signal was spun off from the Heritage Foundation in June 2024, and the 2025 RfC close did not address its reliability or functional independence.

''HuffPost''{{'}}s reliability has increased since 2012; articles before 2012 are less reliable and should be treated with more caution.

| Until 2018, the U.S. edition of ''HuffPost'' published content written by contributors with near-zero editorial oversight. These contributors generally did not have a reputation for fact-checking, and most editors consider them highly variable in quality. Editors show consensus for treating ''HuffPost'' contributor articles as [[WP:SPS|self-published sources]], unless the article was written by a [[WP:EXPERTSOURCE|subject-matter expert]]. ''HuffPost'' contributor articles should never be used for [[WP:THIRDPARTY|third-party claims]] about [[WP:BLPSPS|living persons]].

| The content on IMDb is [[WP:UGC|user-generated]], and the site is considered unreliable by a majority of editors. [[WP:Citing IMDb]] describes two exceptions. Although certain content on the site is reviewed by staff, editors criticize the quality of IMDb's fact-checking. A number of editors have pointed out that IMDb content has been copied from other sites, including Wikipedia, and that there have been a number of notable hoaxes in the past. The use of IMDb as an external link is generally considered appropriate (see [[WP:IMDB-EL]]).
