As an advocacy group, the SPLC is a [[WP:BIASED|biased and opinionated source]].

| There is a general consensus that at least some articles by ''Sports Illustrated'' post-acquisition by [[Maven Networks]] in June 2019 are considered unreliable. Following the purchase, Maven employed independent contractors for low pay and no benefits to write for the magazine, leading to a gradual decline in quality. This culminated in November 2023 when it was revealed that artificial intelligence (AI) had been used to write product review articles with little to no human oversight. While some veteran writers recognized as subject matter experts remain reliable on a case-by-case basis, editors should exercise caution to ensure that articles were not produced by AI or uncredited authors bylined as "SI Staff".

[[WP:CITE|References]] from ''The Sun'' are actively discouraged from being used in any article and they should not be used for determining the [[WP:N|notability]] of any subject.

| There is no consensus on the reliability of TMZ. Although TMZ is cited by reliable sources, most editors consider TMZ a low-quality source and prefer more reliable sources when available. Because TMZ frequently publishes articles based on rumor and speculation without named sources, it is recommended to explicitly [[WP:INTEXT|attribute]] statements to TMZ if used. When TMZ is the only source for a piece of information, consider also whether the information constitutes [[WP:DUE|due or undue weight]], especially when the subject is a [[WP:BLP|living person]].

| {{WP:RSPLAST|2024}}
| As of 2024, there is consensus that Town and Village Guide is a directory service scraping Google Maps and is probably AI-generated. It lacks information as to its publisher, fact checking, and editorial board, making it a [[WP:SPS|self-published source]].

| The Truth About Guns is a [[WP:BLOGS|group blog]]. There is consensus that TTAG does not have a strong reputation for fact-checking and accuracy.

| Twitter (rebranded to X since July 2023) is a social network. As a [[WP:SPS|self-published source]], it is considered generally unreliable and should be avoided unless the author is a [[WP:EXPERTSOURCE|subject-matter expert]] or the tweet is used for an [[WP:ABOUTSELF|uncontroversial self-description]]. In most cases, Twitter accounts should only be cited if the user's identity is confirmed in some way. Tweets that are not covered by reliable sources are likely to constitute [[WP:UNDUE|undue weight]]. Twitter should never be used for [[WP:THIRDPARTY|third-party claims]] claims related to [[WP:BLPSPS|living persons]].
