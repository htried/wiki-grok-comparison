| Due to persistent abuse, ''NewsFront'' is on the [[WP:SPB|Wikipedia spam blacklist]], and links must be [[Wikipedia talk:WHITELIST|whitelisted]] before they can be used. ''NewsFront'' was deprecated in the 2019 RfC, which showed unanimous consensus that the site publishes [[fake news]] and Russian propaganda. The use of ''NewsFront'' as a reference should be generally prohibited, especially when other sources exist that are more [[WP:RS|reliable]]. ''NewsFront'' should not be used for determining [[WP:N|notability]], or used as a [[WP:SECONDARY|secondary source]] in articles.

| There is consensus that articles from ''Newsweek'' pre-2013 are generally reliable for news covered during that time. In 2011, ''Newsweek'' was a reputable magazine with only some minor problems while it was owned by [[The Newsweek Daily Beast Company]] (which also owned ''{{pslink|The Daily Beast}}''). Blogs under ''Newsweek'', including The Gaggle, should be handled with the [[WP:NEWSBLOG]] policy. ''See also: [[#Newsweek (2013-present)|Newsweek (2013–present)]].''

| Unlike articles before 2013, ''Newsweek'' articles since 2013 are not generally reliable. From 2013 to 2018, ''Newsweek'' was owned and operated by [[IBT Media]], the parent company of ''{{pslink|International Business Times}}''. IBT Media introduced a number of bad practices to the once reputable magazine and mainly focused on [[clickbait]] headlines over quality journalism. Its current relationship with IBT Media is unclear, and ''Newsweek''{{'}}s quality has not returned to its status prior to the 2013 purchase. Many editors have noted that there are several exceptions to this standard, so consensus is to evaluate ''Newsweek'' content on a case-by-case basis. In addition, as of April 2024, ''Newsweek'' has disclosed that they make use of AI assistance to write articles. ''See also: {{pslink|Newsweek (pre-2013)}}.''

Some editors also express concern about past attempts by NGO Monitor staff to manipulate coverage of itself on Wikipedia.
